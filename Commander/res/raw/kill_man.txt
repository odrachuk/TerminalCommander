NAME
       kill - terminate a process

SYNOPSIS
       kill [-s signal|-p] [-q sigval] [-a] [--] pid...
       kill -l [signal]

DESCRIPTION
       The  command  kill sends the specified signal to the specified process or process group.  If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent.  The
       TERM signal will kill processes which do not catch this signal.  For other processes, it may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal,  since  this
       signal cannot be caught.

       Most  modern  shells  have a builtin kill function, with a usage rather similar to that of the command described here.  The `-a' and `-p' options,
       and the possibility to specify processes by command name are a local extension.

       If sig is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed.

OPTIONS
       pid... Specify the list of processes that kill should signal.  Each pid can be one of five things:


              n      where n is larger than 0.  The process with pid n will be signaled.

              0      All processes in the current process group are signaled.

              -1     All processes with pid larger than 1 will be signaled.

              -n     where n is larger than 1.  All processes in process group n are signaled.  When an argument of the form `-n' is  given,  and  it  is
                     meant  to denote a process group, either the signal must be specified first, or the argument must be preceded by a `--' option, oth‚Äê
                     erwise it will be taken as the signal to send.

              commandname
                     All processes invoked using that name will be signaled.

       -s signal
              Specify the signal to send.  The signal may be given as a signal name or number.

       -l     Print a list of signal names.  These are found in /usr/include/linux/signal.h

       -a     Do not restrict the commandname-to-pid conversion to processes with the same uid as the present process.

       -p     Specify that kill should only print the process id (pid) of the named processes, and not send any signals.

       -q sigval
              Use sigqueue(2) rather than kill(2) and the sigval argument is used to specify an integer to be sent with the  signal.   If  the  receiving
              process  has  installed  a handler for this signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2), then it can obtain this data via the si_value
              field of the siginfo_t structure.
